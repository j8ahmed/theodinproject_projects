# Inventory Management Application

> For this project you are going to create an Inventory management app for an imaginary store. It’s up to you what kind of business this is – you could be selling groceries, car parts, baby-toys, musical-instruments, ponies or anything!

I have decided to build an inventory management application for a **grocery store**. I am pressed for time and would like to focus on the core coding concepts more so than my creative vision. There are other ideas I would rather do but I am very comfortable with grocery stores.

## Requirements:

The app must have:

- Categories - All CRUD operations
- Items - All CRUD operations
- When a user goes to the home-page they can choose a category to view, and then get a list of every item in that category (Similar to the Local Library tutorial project)

## Plans

### Models needs in database for Grocery Store:

```
Category:
---------
Fields
  - name
  - description
  - Virtuals
    - url

Item:
-----
Fields:
  - name
  - price
  - category
  - description
  - stock-quantity
  - Virtuals
    - url

```

### Routes

```
Category:
---------

Routes
  - create (construct)
  - read
  - update
  - delete


Item:
-----

Routes
  - create (construct) 
  - read
  - update
  - delete

```

## Tasks

1. [ ] Finish writing basic plans for the app.
2. [ ] Construct file/folder structure skeleton for the app.
