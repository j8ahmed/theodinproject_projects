## Core Operations:

```
How can I ensure there are less bugs with:
  1. Chaining operations
  2. Adjusting operators

In most calculators one math operation is evaluated at a time.
The basic math operation involves 4 steps:
  1. Input the first number
  2. Input the operator
  3. Input the second number
  4. Press "=" to perform the math operation by applying the operand to the first and second number.

Although that is the generic process, there are a few extra options available at each step
that will impact the operation.

Options while inputting the first number:

  - Add a decimal place (only allow one)
  - Add leading zeros (bad)
  - Backspace (correct input - Bonus)
  - Clear (reset the calculator - global)

Options while inputting the operator:

  - Change the operator
  - Pressing the operator button multiple times (Should just change the operator)
  - 

Options while inputting the second number:

  - Add a decimal place (only allow one)
  - Add leading zeros (bad)
  - Backspace (correct input - Bonus)
  - Clear (reset the calculator - global)

```
