## Bug Fixes

### Random bug after webpack build `TypeError: console.log() is not a function`

Had to do with not adding a `;` at the end of my line followed by and IIFE. This [Stack Overflow Question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31013221/typeerror-console-log-is-not-a-function) and answer provided me with the solution to the problem and why the error was happening.
